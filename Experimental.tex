The aim of this chapter is to analyse the outdoor experimental performance of the solar air heater prototype fabricated using the concentrator designed in Chapter \ref{Cap:Opt}. This air heating system was fabricated and tested at Technological University Dublin, Ireland. The specific objectives are to:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Present the materials and components for fabrication;
	\item Describe the data collection procedure and equipment used;
	\item Evaluate the thermal performance of the system in open loop configuration.
\end{itemize}

\section{Materials for the prototype}
	
\subsection{Absorber surface selection}

The function of the absorber surface in solar thermal systems is to retain thermal energy from incoming solar radiation. To meet this objective, carbon fibre weave fabric has been selected to be the absorbing material (Figure \ref{CFphoto}). Although it is not conventionally employed in solar air heating systems (\cite{Shams2013}), its utilisation brings two advantages: i) it has natural perforations, and; ii) it reduces the system's weight -- compared to an aluminium plate of same dimensions, the carbon fibre surface is 40\% lighter.

\Figure[scale=0.3,placement=!ht,label={CFphoto},caption={Carbon fibre weave fabric (\cite{EasyComposites2017}).}]{figs/CFphoto.PNG}

Carbon fibre weave's physical properties are presented in Table \ref{carbonfiber}. Absorptivity data were reported by \citet{Wu2012}, whereas thermal conductivity and specific heat were obtained from the material supplier Easy Composites (\cite{EasyComposites2017}). \mbox{Despite} being a modest thermal conductor, \citet{Gawlik2005} reported that this factor poorly influences the thermal efficiency of an air heating system with perforated absorber.

\begin{table}[!ht]

\end{table}

The carbon fibre weave fabric is in the form of yarns, made of multi-filaments, where the type of weave is taken into consideration according to the application (\cite{Tourlonias2016}). The area between the woven yarns are the perforations where the flowing air passes through. This porosity was calculated from data of morphology image (Figure \ref{CFmag}) by \citet{Shams2013}. The average values of perforation area and porosity are 0.147 mm$^2$ and 4.2\%, respectively and will be input as parameters in the thermal modelling depicted in \mbox{Chapter \ref{Cap:Thermal}}. The cost of this carbon fibre weave fabric was 24 \euro/${\rm m^2}$.

\Figure[scale=0.65,placement=!ht,label={CFmag},caption={Morphology image of carbonfibre sample taken at magnification of 15x.}]{figs/CFmag}

To assemble the carbon fibre fabric to the prototype, epoxy laminating resin was applied at the corners of the surface to avoid any splitting in the weave and to keep the surface stretched. These corners were attached to a thin wooden frame of specific absorber dimensions (0.145 m x 1.25 m).

\subsection{Glazing cover selection}

The function of a glazing surface is to protect the interior of a thermal system from weather conditions (rain, wind, dust accumulation) and suppress thermal losses. However, the solar radiation effectively transmitted to the air heating system is reduced due to absorption and reflection at the glazing cover. Therefore, a glazing material that enhances light transmission and avoid losses is needed. For the task, the selected glazing material for this system is a 4-mm thick tempered clear glass slab. This tempered property enables the glass to be safer and more durable than ordinary glasses. It withstands 5 times more impact before shattering, and, if shattered, the fragments pose a reduced danger to the user, making it an attractive product for use in both commercial and domestic applications (\cite{FirstGlass2016}). The glass properties, such as absorptivity and transmittance, are shown in Table \ref{glass_tempered}. From the collector's design, the glazing dimensions are \mbox{0.27 m x 1.25 m}. The cost of the glass was 70 \euro/${\rm m^2}$.

\subsection{Reflector surface selection}

The reflective material employed is called \textit{MiroSun} from the German company Alanod, its only product used for solar applications. This reflective aluminium sheet is manufactured using continuous physical vapour deposition (PVD) process applied for a super reflective layer to coil anodized material and afterwards the surface is protected by a nano-composite in a coil-coating process. Table \ref{reflector_M} shows optical and physical properties of this material. From the concentrator's design, the total area of reflector sheet used was 1.25 m x 1.20 m. The cost of the Alanod reflector was 50 \euro/${\rm m^2}$.

\subsection{Prototype's structure}

The materials used to fabricate the prototype's structure are listed as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item 0.7 m$^2$ of a 2-mm thick aluminium sheet to form the ends;
	\item 8 aluminium bars of 1.25 m in length to support and keep the reflectors in the desired position;
	\item 0.45 m$^2$ of 1-cm thick timber to form a cavity above the absorber surface in order to reduce heat losses;
	\item two 2.5-in diameter aluminium pipe of 10 cm in length for the airflow inlet and outlet;
	\item 1.8 m$^2$ of a 0.6-mm thick aluminium sheet to box the whole structure.
	
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{Ass11} shows photographs of the assembled structure. The space between the reflectors and the outer aluminium sheet was filled by fibre glass wool to provide thermal insulation. The structure was wrapped with polyurethane foam board and sealed with waterproof tape.

\section{Instrumentation of the experimental unit}

Temperatures were measured at the inlet and outlet of air, absorber and glazing surfaces using type T (Cu-CuNi) PTFE insulated twist fine wire thermocouple sensors with accuracy of Â±0.5 $^{\rm{o}}$C. Figures \ref{TC_abs} and \ref{TC_glaz} indicate the position of each thermocouples on the absorber and glazing surfaces, respectively. 18 thermocouples were used in total. As a matter of orientation, in both figures the side where the thermocouple 1 is placed is the closest to the outlet.

\Figure[scale=0.50,placement=!ht,label={TC_abs},caption={Positions of the 12 thermocouples numbered from 1 to 12 placed on the absorber surface (dimensions in mm).}]{figs/absorber_thermocouple.PNG}

\Figure[scale=0.50,placement=!ht,label={TC_glaz},caption={Position of the three thermocouples numbered from 1 to 3 placed on the glazing surface (dimensions in mm).}]{figs/glass_thermocouple.PNG}

These temperature measurements were recorded at 1 minute intervals with a DL2e data logger connected directly to a computer where the temperature data were downloaded via USB port (\cite{Devices2018}). All thermocouples were labelled, inserted in a plug and connected to the data logger.

The airflow was provided by a 12-W fan, where the rate was varied by a voltage adaptor with five different voltage inputs. The air velocity at the air outlet ($\rm{v_{out}}$) was measured using a Testo 425 hot wire anemometer. These airflow conditions were converted to airflow values using Eq. (\ref{Gpitot}).

%\begin{equation}
%\mathrm{{v_{out}} = \sqrt {\frac{{2{\mathrm{P_{out}}}}}{{{\mathrm{d_{air}}}}}}}
%\label{Vpitot}
%\end{equation}

\vspace{-0.75cm}
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{{G_{air}} = \frac{{{v_{out}}{A_{out}}{d_{air}}}}{{{A_{abs}}}}}
\label{Gpitot}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\rm{A_{out}}$ is the cross section area of the outlet pipe and $\rm{A_{abs}}$ is the absorber area.

The measured variables are subjected to systematic uncertainties due to instrumentation errors. It is thus necessary to calculate the standard uncertainty of each variable measured for the experimental work. Those measurements are temperature, air velocity and solar radiation. The accuracy of each instrument, taken from the manufacturer data, are shown in Table \ref{uncertainty}.

%By calculating the mass airflow rate at each level of voltage supply $\rm{V_a}$, a graph correlating both variables is shown in Figure \ref{Gair_V}. Moreover, Table \ref{GxV} shows the values of each airflow rate at each level of voltage.

%\Figure[scale=0.55,placement=!ht,label={P_V},caption={Calibration of the fan to calculate pressure using Pitot tube.}]{figs/P_V.eps}

%\Figure[scale=0.50,placement=!ht,label={Gair_V},caption={Mass airflow rate vs. supply voltage}]{figs/Gair_V.eps}

Table \ref{GxV} shows the values of air velocity and airflow rate as function of the voltage input ($\rm{V_a}$) in terms of mass per absorber area ($\rm{G_{air}}$), volume and a category corresponding to each level. Systematic uncertainties were also calculated for the airflow rate (${\rm u_g}$).

%The pressure drop across the prototype was calculated at each airflow level and are presented in Figure \ref{dP-Gair}.

A schematic diagram of the open loop experimental system is shown in Figure \ref{scheme_p}. A flexible duct was connected to the inlet of prototype. Air flowed through the air duct to the collector by the fan. The power supply unit provided voltage to the fan and energy to the data logger. Figure \ref{unit1} presents the prototype's front view. It was fixed to the ground to prevent it from moving due to severe wind conditions. The fan was enclosed and protected from the environment during the experiments and the data logger was placed behind the prototype.

\section{Experimental results from the air heating prototype}

This section presents the experimental results from tests conducted at the five airflow rates and also the ones with no flow. The thermal performance of the prototype focused on evaluating the useful energy rate (or energy delivered), collector thermal efficiency and outlet air temperature. The useful heat rate transferred to the airflow is estimated by Eq. (\ref{usefulenergy}) (\cite{Kalogirou2004}) using temperature measurements from the inlet and outlet:

\vspace{-0.75cm}
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{{Q_u} = {G_{air}}{A_{abs}}{C_{p,air}}({T_{out}} - {T_{in}})}
\label{usefulenergy}
\end{equation}

The thermal efficiency, which is the ratio of useful heat rate to the incoming total solar radiation on the aperture, is calculated by Eq. (\ref{ThermalEf2}). Such efficiency can be evaluated either instantaneously or as an average over a certain period of time (\cite{Goswami2015}):

\vspace{-0.75cm}
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{\mathlarger{\eta}_{\mathrm{th}} = \frac{Q_u}{I_{\!_T}A_{apt}}}
\label{ThermalEf2}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\rm{I_{\!_T}}$ is the total incoming solar radiation. The solar data used in the calculations were downloaded from the Met Eireann website (\cite{MetEireann2018}). Such data were measured by a solar pyranometer placed at the horizontal.

\subsection{Experimental results at transient state}

Experimental results of measured temperatures and solar radiation were used to calculate energies and thermal efficiency on hourly basis. One day of each level of airflow rate was taken for data treatment and discussion, from 9:00 to 17:00 in 2018.

\subsubsection{Experimental results at zero airflow}

The equilibrium temperature that the absorber approaches when no energy is removed from the collector is called stagnation temperature (\cite{Rabl1985}). In order to verify this condition, the inlet and outlet of the system were closed and two tests at clear sky days were performed on 2$^{\rm{nd}}$ and 3$^{\rm{rd}}$ July as shown in Figure \ref{zero12}. The maximum stagnation absorber temperature reached 77 $^{\rm{o}}$C in both tests at an average $\rm{I_{\!_T}}$ of 820 W/m$^{\rm{2}}$ and $\rm{T_{amb}}$ of 22 $^{\rm{o}}$C.

\Figure[scale=0.70,placement=!ht,label={zero12},caption={Experimental results from 2$^{\rm{nd}}$ and 3$^{\rm{rd}}$ July at zero airflow.}]{figs/zero12.eps}

\subsubsection{Experimental results with airflow}

The findings of a low airflow rate (0.038 kg/m$^2$.s) experiment are presented in Figure \ref{004}. It was conducted on June 9$^{\rm{th}}$ under clear sky conditions with highest values of solar radiation at the solar noon hour (13:00 -- 14:00), where its peak is 860 W/m$^2$. During this hour, the average outlet airflow temperature $\rm{T_{out}}$, ambient temperature $\rm{T_{amb}}$, and thermal efficiency $\eta_{\rm{th}}$ were observed to have average values of 51 $^{\rm{o}}$C, 23 $^{\rm{o}}$C, and 0.53, respectively. At around the peak of solar radiation, the maximum $\rm{T_{out}}$ was found to be 51 $^{\rm{o}}$C, resulting in an airflow temperature rise of 28 $^{\rm{o}}$C and a corresponding $\eta_{\rm{th}}$ of 0.54. The total incident solar radiation received during the test was estimated to be 20.46 MJ/m$^2$, of which a total useful energy collected $\rm{Q_{u}}$ of 7.64 MJ/m$^2$ was calculated, resulting in a daily thermal efficiency of 0.35.

The results of an experiment conducted at a low-medium airflow rate (0.055 kg/m$^2$.s) under relatively clear sky conditions are depicted in Figure \ref{0055}. During the solar noon hour (13:00 -- 14:00), the airflow collected 1.7 MJ/m$^2$ of energy at an average outlet temperature of 43 $^{\rm{o}}$C and thermal efficiency of 55\%. The highest outlet temperature ($\rm{T_{out}}$) was recorded as 42 $^{\rm{o}}$C when the ambient temperature ($\rm{T_{amb}}$) was 20 $^{\rm{o}}$C, resulting in the maximum temperature rise of 22 $^{\rm{o}}$C. The total solar energy available was 21.29 MJ/m$^2$, while the total useful energy collected was 9.56 MJ/m$^2$. The thermal efficiency obtained for this day was 43\%.

It was tested on June 28$^{\rm{th}}$ under clear sky conditions with highest values of solar radiation at the expected solar noon hour, where its peak was 850 W/m$^2$. During this hour, the average values of $\rm{T_{out}}$, $\rm{T_{amb}}$, and $\eta_{\rm{th}}$ were 38 $^{\rm{o}}$C, 27 $^{\rm{o}}$C, and 0.62, respectively. At around the peak of solar radiation, the maximum $\rm{T_{out}}$ was found to be 39 $^{\rm{o}}$C, resulting in the maximum airflow temperature rise of 12 $^{\rm{o}}$C and a corresponding $\eta_{\rm{th}}$ of 0.65. The total incident solar radiation during the test was estimated to be 21.07 MJ/m$^2$, of which a total useful energy collected $\rm{Q_{u}}$ was 9.8 MJ/m$^2$, resulting in a daily thermal efficiency of 0.47.

\subsection{Experimental characterisation at nearly steady state}

The thermal characterisation of a solar air heating relates the thermal efficiency under steady state to each temperature rise normalised by the corresponding solar radiation according to the Hottel-Whillier-Bliss equation, expressed by Eq. (\ref{hottel-whiller-eq2}).

\vspace{-0.75cm}
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{\eta_{\rm{th}} = {F_{\!_R}}\eta_o - {F_{\!_R}}{U_{\!_L}}\frac{(T_{out} - T_{amb})}{I_{\!_T}}}
\label{hottel-whiller-eq2}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\rm{U_{\!_L}}$ is the system's overall heat loss coefficient and $\rm{F_{\!_R}}$ is the heat removal factor. From this equation, $\eta_{\rm{th}}$ can be plotted against $\rm{(T_{out} - T_{amb})/I_{\!_T}}$, resulting in a linear curve, with $\rm{F_{\!_R}}\eta_{\rm{o}}$ and $\rm{- F_{\!_R}{U_{\!_L}}}$ as the linear coefficient and the slope, respectively (\cite{Goswami2015}). 
%From this, the maximum thermal efficiency is $\rm{F_{\!_R}}\eta_{\rm{o}}$ when all the radiation absorbed is transferred to the airflow, but at no temperature change.

The experimental data collected for this analysis were during 10 minutes of tests around the solar noon period of clear days (nearly steady state condition), including all the five airflow rates. This is the period where the direct radiation range is at maximum, which was 800 -- 900 W/m$^{\rm{2}}$. To minimise the effects of the system's heat capacity, the data were taken in nearly symmetrical pairs, one before and one after noon, thus resulting in five averaged pairs for each day of experimental tests (\cite{Duffie2013}). Thermal efficiency was calculated by Eq. (\ref{ThermalEf2}). With all the data collected, the thermal efficiency curve was plotted in Figure \ref{ef_curve}.

From these results, the parameters of Eq. (\ref{hottel-whiller-eq2}) were calculated: $\rm{F_{\!_R}}\eta_{\rm{o}}$ and $\rm{F_{\!_R}{U_{\!_L}}}$ are 0.652 $\pm$ 0.008 and -3.383 $\pm$ 0.328 respectively, and the coefficient of correlation is 0.8. It is important to state that $\rm{U_{\!_L}}$ is assumed to be weakly dependent on the absorber temperature in this operational range, where $\rm{(T_{out} - T_{amb})/I_{\!_T}}$ is between 0.015 and 0.037 m$^{\rm{2}}$.$^{\rm{o}}$C/W, so that the heat loss coefficient is constant (\cite{Rabl1985}). Comparing to other work, \citet{Shams2016} characterised experimentally a solar air heating system with a similar geometry. For this, they calculated the instantaneous thermal efficiency when the solar radiation varied between 937.6 and 1,085.4 W/m$^{\rm{2}}$. This resulted in a linear coefficient ($\rm{F_{\!_R}}\eta_{\rm{o}}$) of 0.73 and slope ($\rm{F_{\!_R}{U_{\!_L}}}$) of -3.25 W/m$^{\rm{2}}$.$^{\rm{o}}$C.

Next, Figure \ref{ef-Tout-Gair} shows thermal efficiency and outlet air temperature as functions of the mass airflow rate. From the thermal efficiency graph, it is possible to view a smooth increase in $\eta_{\rm{th}}$ when $\rm{G_{air}}$ becomes higher. The opposite behaviour is observed in the airflow temperature rise $(\rm{T_{out}} - \rm{T_{in}})$, where this variable drops dramatically when $\rm{G_{air}}$ varies from 0.04 to 0.09 kg/m$^2$.s and then falls smoothly by 2 $^{\rm{o}}$C.

\section{Chapter summary}

The fabrication of a solar air heating prototype for outdoor experimental tests has been detailed in this chapter. This chapter outlined the selection of materials, fabrication process of the system and the data collection apparatus. Carbon fibre weave with 85\% absorptivity was selected as the absorber material for the collector considering its properties of the material and the inherent perforation. 95\% reflectivity \textit{Mirosun} reflector sheet from the company âAlanodâ was selected as the reflector material. Tempered clear glass of 4 mm in thickness with 90\% transmittance was selected as the glazing cover.

The experiments were carried out in open loop configuration, where the air was blown by a 12-W fan with a voltage adaptor to vary the airflow rate. Experimental results were analysed for different airflow rates ranging between 0.04 and 0.115 kg/m$^2$.s. Results show that the maximum outlet air temperatures at solar noon (13:00 to 14:00) varied from 40 $^{\rm{o}}$C at the highest airflow to 52 $^{\rm{o}}$C at the lowest and the thermal efficiency varied from 52\% to 62\%. 

Results were also evaluated at nearly steady state condition, period where the direct radiation range is at maximum at solar noon, which was 800 -- 900 W/m$^{\rm{2}}$. It was possible to plot the thermal efficiency curve in order to characterise the system. The parameters of the Hottel-Whillier-Bliss equation were calculated, where $\rm{F_{\!_R}}\eta_{\rm{o}}$ and $\rm{F_{\!_R}{U_{\!_L}}}$ are 0.65 and -3.39 respectively. The air temperature rise varied from 10 $^{\rm{o}}$C at the highest airflow rate to 26 $^{\rm{o}}$C at the lowest.
