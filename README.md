# My PhD thesis: Building Integration of a Solar Air Heating System

### Abstract:

In order to achieve the global carbon emission target, the high fraction of locally
available renewable energy sources will become necessary to meet energy demand. Solar
energy is one of the most important renewable sources locally available for use in space
heating, cooling, hot water supply and power production. Building integrated solar thermal systems (BISTS) can be a potential solution towards the enhanced energy efficiency
and reduced operational cost in built environment. The current research aimed at developing an active solar air heating collector for building integration. This system consisted of
several asymmetric compound parabolic concentrating collectors with inverted transpired
absorber stacked on the top of each other capable of receiving direct solar insolation for 8
hours/day during the summer season. An optical analysis was carried out with the assistance of a 3D ray tracing technique in order to investigate the optical performance through
a parametric analysis, and thus to decide the design to be used as a prototype. It has dimensions of 0.42 m x 0.40 m x 1.25 m and concentration ration 2.28, able to absorb up
to 67% of direct solar radiation in the period of operation. Subsequently, the prototype
was experimentally tested by using five different air flow rates (22 – 60 kg/h) in open loop
configuration. Experimental results show that, on clear days and in periods of high solar
insolation (greater than 800 W/m²), the airflow temperature rise varied between 12 ºC
(at the highest airflow rate) and 27 ºC (at the smallest rate), characterising thus thermal
efficiencies between 52 – 62%. After experimental characterisation, a thermal modelling
based on energy balance was undertaken with the objective of simulating the collector’s
thermal performance for further control of multiple units connected altogether. Validation of this model indicates that it predicts data of air temperature delivered and energy
collected with uncertainties of ± 2 ºC and ± 50 W/m² of absorber area, respectively. The
thermal modelling was also used to predict the thermal performance of three collectors
connected in series and in parallel. The connection in series was able to deliver higher
outlet airflow temperatures (higher than 70 ºC on a clear day), whereas the connection in
parallel can collect more useful heat but delivering the same airflow temperature as if it
is leaving the first collector in series. Lastly, this model was used for simulating barley
drying. Three scenarios were employed to fulfill energy requirements: using only a gas
burner to heat the airflow to 60 °C, combining a solar heating system with a gas burner
to achieve the same temperature, and solely relying on the solar heating system without
an air temperature limit. For a specific airflow level, the gas burner system consumed the
most gas and had a solar fraction of 0, indicating full reliance on gas for heating. Conversely, the standalone Solar Air Heating System (SAHS) yielded less dried mass, but
both configurations achieved a solar fraction of 1, signifying exclusive reliance on solar
energy. Results demonstrate that incorporating solar air heating systems can significantly
reduce the need for natural gas heating. Specifically, the gas burner + SAHS in parallel
exhibited the lowest gas consumption and the highest solar fraction among all the gas
burner-based systems.
